# Pet-Breeds-Analysis
Excel, Analyse and present findings via Powerpoint Presentation

I have a structured data of dog and cat breeds. I want you to do the following:
1. Consolidate dog and cat breeds list in 1 excel file. Create 1 worksheet for cats and 
another worksheet for dogs.
2. Add a column to both worksheets called “Average Sales” and compute for the average 
sales for each cat and dog breed.
3. Add another worksheet called “Summary”
4. Display total count of cats per fur type.
5. Display total count of dogs per group1 category.
6. Using excel functions, display the following breeds. Display the top and bottom breeds 
with 1-10 popularity: 
a. Top 10 cat breeds based on popularity
b. Top 10 dog breeds based on popularity
c. Bottom 10 cat breeds based on popularity
d. Bottom 10 dog breeds based on popularity
Note that there can be multiple breeds with the same popularity, output can be more 
than 10 breeds.
7. Compute for the average price of:
a. Top 10 and bottom 10 cat breeds and
b. Top 10 and bottom 10 dog breeds
Round off to the nearest 2 decimal places only.
8. Find the mode based on the temperament of:
a. Cat breeds 
b. Dog breeds
9. Print the following:
a. Total count of cats which have an affectionate temperament
b. Total count of dogs which have an affectionate temperament
10. Create/ formulate 2 more summaries based on your own analysis. Send me the excel 
file once done


Given the structured and consolidated data of dog and cat breeds, I want you to do the
following:
1. Create a pivot chart for cat breeds and display the following:
a. Total count of cat breeds per fur type
b. Total count of cat breeds with and without “affectionate” temperament”
c. Add a slicer based on lap cat column
2. Create a pivot charts for dog breeds and display the following:
a. Total count of dog breeds per Group 2
b. Total count of dogs with and without “affectionate” temperament
c. Add a slicer based on group 1 column
3. Add more slicers or filters based on your own analysis

For this deliverable, I need you to create a PowerPoint Presentation based on the summaries,
pivots, and other data analytics you have completed using the given data.
I would also like you to present the top breed with most and least sales in both cat and dog
breeds. If you already have these findings based on your analysis, then you can just copy and
paste the results to your presentation. If you don’t have any findings about these yet, you can go
back to your excel file and find the breeds with the most and least sales using excel functions.
Please provide clear and concise descriptions of each graph.
